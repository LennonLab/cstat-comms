Hi Megan,

Attached please find the 4 .sff files that Claire used in her analyses.  There are also 2 Oligos files which describe which barcode is for which samples.  syn1.oligos is for sff files G3I0UTA01.sff and G3I0UTA02.sff and syn2.oligos is for .sff files G3I0UTA03.sff and G3I0UTA04.sff.

Please let me know if you have any questions or problems downloading the files.

Best Wishes,

Gary
